\title{Plot a Glycan Structure as an igraph Tree}
\usage{
plot_glycan_tree(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An `igraph` object representing a glycan structure.
Nodes should contain residue type information in `V(g)$type` and
vertex colors in `V(g)$color`, as assigned by `build_glycan_igraph()`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns `NULL`. A glycan tree plot is drawn as a side effect.
}
\description{
Visualize a glycan structure represented as an `igraph` object using a
tree layout.
This function is primarily used to inspect glycan topology produced
by parsing functions such as `wurcs_to_tree()` or `pGlyco3_to_tree()`,
after conversion to an igraph representation via `build_glycan_igraph()`.
}
\details{
The glycan is drawn with:

* a tree layout rooted at `"a"`
* node labels showing residue types

This function produces a base R plot and returns no value.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
g <- build_glycan_igraph(wurcs_to_tree("WURCS=..."))
plot_glycan_tree(g)
}

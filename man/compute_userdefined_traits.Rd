\title{Compute user-defined structural glycan traits via subgraph isomorphism}
\usage{
compute_userdefined_traits(tree, motifs)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A parsed glycan tree from \code{\link{pGlyco3_to_tree}} or \code{\link{wurcs_to_tree}}.}

\item{motifs}{Optional named list of user-defined motif trees.
Each motif must include:
\itemize{
  \item `node`: character vector of residue codes
  \item `edge`: edges describing motif topology
}}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector giving the count of each user-defined motif.
Returns an empty vector if \code{motifs = NULL}.
}
\description{
Evaluate custom glycan structural motifs within a parsed glycan tree.
Each user-defined motif is represented as a parsed tree (`node` + `edge`),
converted into an `igraph` structure, and matched against the full glycan
using subgraph isomorphism (`igraph::count_subgraph_isomorphisms()`).
}
\details{
This function allows end users to define their own glycan structural motifs—
such as specific antenna patterns, branch-residue
combinations—and quantify how often these motifs appear in a glycan.
The output is a named numeric vector where names correspond to motif names.

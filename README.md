## Introduction

**Glycoproteomics** is a rapidly expanding field, but analyzing the
LC-MS data remains a complex, multi-step process. In [the
post](https://lgatto.codeberg.page/death-research-software/), Laurent
emphasizes that software is a central player in scientific research.
Here is his simple but powerful equation:

> **Experimental design + data + software = results**

For glycoproteomics data, advanced search engines such as Byonic,
MSFragger, pGlyco3, Glyco-Decipher, and StructGP are indispensable for
identifying glycopeptides. However, identification alone is not the end
of the workflow.

Researchers need downstream analytical tools to: interpret glycan
structural features, quantify glycan heterogeneity, compare biological
groups, and extract mechanistic insight.

To address this need, we developed **glycoTraitR**, an R package that
extends the analysis capability to the glycoproteomics context:

> **Software = Software (search engine) + Software (analysis tool, e.g.,
> glycoTraitR)**

glycoTraitR is designed for users who want to go beyond simple
differential analysis, extracting, summarizing, and analyzing glycan
structural traits from GPSM data generated by **pGlyco3** or
**Glyco-Decipher**.

It provides a streamlined workflow for:

- parsing WURCS 2.0 and pGlyco3 glycan strings
- computing composition & structural traits
- summarizing glycan–PSM trait matrices at site/protein level
  (`SummarizedExperiment`)
- performing differential trait analysis and visualizing trait changes
